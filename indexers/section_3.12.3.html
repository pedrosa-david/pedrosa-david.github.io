<h1>3.12.3 Clock Generator (CLOCK)</h1>
<p>The PIC32CZ_CA clock system has the following modules and features:</p>
<p>Clock sources, i.e. oscillators controlled by OSCCTRL and OSC32KCTRL.</p>
<p>A clock source provides a time base that is used by other
components, such as Generic Clock Generators. Example clock sources are
the external crystal oscillator (XOSC) and the Digital Frequency Locked
Loop (DFLL48M).</p>
<p>There are also 2 DPLL's available as clock sources. One is for
system functions and one with a Fractional Divider for audio
applications.</p>
<p>Generic Clock Controller (GCLK), which generates, controls and
distributes the asynchronous clock consisting of:</p>
<p>Generic Clock Generators</p>
<p>Generic Clocks</p>
<p>The MCLK generates and controls the synchronous clocks on the
system. This includes the CPU, bus clocks (APB, AHB) as well as the
synchronous (to the CPU) user interfaces of the peripherals. It
contains clock masks that can turn on/off the user interface of a
peripheral as well as pre-scalers for the CPU and bus clocks</p>
<p>Start-up 6Mhz Clock</p>
<p>This clock is used during the power up sequence of the device by
the SUL and SUPC macros.</p>
