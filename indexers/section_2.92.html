<h1><span id="2-92-reinforced-safety-watchdog-timer-rswdt"></span>2.92 Reinforced Safety Watchdog Timer (RSWDT)</h1>
<p>The RSWDT works in parallel with the Watchdog Timer (WDT) to reinforce
safe watchdog operations.</p>
<p>The RSWDT is a 12-bit down counter that allows a watchdog period of up
to 16 seconds with a 32kHz slow clock. It should be fed periodically
before it counts down to zero. If the timer counts down to zero, it
will reset the device.</p>
<p>The RSWDT uses the Main RC oscillator divided clock (frequency is
equivalent to Slow RC) if the Main RC oscillator is enabled by the
application, or if the WDT is driven by the 32kHz Slow clock.</p>
<p>If the WDT clock source (for example, the 32 kHz crystal oscillator)
fails, the system lock-up is no longer monitored by the WDT and the
RSWDT performs the monitoring with the Main RC oscillator and resets
the device.</p>
<h2><span id="using-the-library"></span>Using The Library</h2>
<p>The RSWDT module runs independent of the rest of the system, causing
system resets whenever it times out. However, the application software
should ensure that the timeout never occurs by resetting the RSWDT
periodically as long as the software is in a known healthy state. If
the system hangs or program execution is corrupted, the RSWDT will not
receive its periodic reset, and will eventually time out and cause a
system reset.</p>
<p>In many systems, there is an obvious upper boundary to the amount of
time each iteration of the main application loop can be expected to
run, before a malfunction can be assumed (either due to a deadlock
waiting on hardware or software, or due to other means). When the RSWDT
is configured with a timeout period equal to this upper boundary, a
malfunction in the system will force a full system reset to allow for a
graceful recovery. The upper boundary is specified by a 12-bit watch
dog period value.</p>
<p>Window Mode</p>
<p>In many system, there is also lower boundary to the amount of time each
iteration of the main application loop can be expected to run. To guard
against a system failure resetting the Watchdog in a tight loop (or a
failure in the system application causing the main loop to run faster
than expected) a watch dog delta value can be specified to disallow
resetting of the Watchdog counter before a certain period of time. Any
attempt to reset the watchdog when the watchdog counter has not counted
down to the delta value results in device reset.</p>
